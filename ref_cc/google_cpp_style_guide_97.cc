<h3 id="Braced_Initializer_List_Format">Braced Initializer List Format</h3>

<p>Format a braced initializer list exactly like you would format a function
call in its place.</p>

<p>If the braced list follows a name (e.g., a type or
variable name), format as if the <code>{}</code> were the
parentheses of a function call with that name. If there
is no name, assume a zero-length name.</p>
